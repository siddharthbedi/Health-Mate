## The problem Health-Mate solves
1. In today's world, we see a lot of psychological problems going undetected. To solve this problem we came up with a solution of asking a user a set of questions to accurately predict and detect the probability of him/her suffering from the disorders.

2. It prevents expensive medical expenditure on consultations and also creates awareness about the lifestyle diseases.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Developing datasets for the parameters given as we are making an app for the layman, not for a doctor.

2.Only a certain number of diseases can be identified and detected due to lack of knowledge and specialization.

3.For people to use it the product had to be associated with a web-app.
